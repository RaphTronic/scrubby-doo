# Scrubby-Doo: a highly effective Recirculating Air Scrubbing Hat for Bambu 3D printers

These recirculating air scrubbing hats for the Bambu H2, P1 (coming) and P2 (coming) series hold ~1kg of activated carbon to very effectively scrub the fumes emitted by 3D printing.

They also prevent deposition of a film of material inside the printer when using ABS and ASA filaments.

The heater versions for the P1 and P2 series also include a heating element to heat the chamber up to 55-60°C for high temp filaments.

All the printing and assembly details can be found in this post: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2026/02/diy-scrubby-doo-recirculating-carbon.html

Happy, clean and rose smelly printing to all !
