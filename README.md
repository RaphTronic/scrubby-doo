# Scrubby-Doo: a Recirculating Fumes-Scrubbing Hat for Bambu P1,X1,P2,H2 3D printers

These highly effective recirculating fumes-scrubbing hats for the Bambu H2, P1/X1 and P2 series hold ~1kg of activated carbon to very effectively scrub the fumes emitted by 3D printing.

They also prevent the pesky deposition of a film of material inside the printer when using ABS and ASA filaments.

Now working on a P1 and a P2 version with a beefy heater so we can finally heat up their chamber fast to 55-60°C to avoid warping with high temp filaments.

The printing and assembly details can be found in these posts: <br />
